                <p class="text-right">November 2017</p>
                <p>Dear Members of the Peer Review Committee,</p>
                <p>It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my peer review portfolio for your consideration. Snce beginning my role as the health educator at Bethel Elementary School in the fall of 2016, I have been working toward my initial teaching license with an endorsement in preschool through sixth grade health. Through a combination of graduate courses, workshops, and classroom work, I have sought to gain the knowledge and skills I need to improve my practice and build a health program that has a positive, meaningful, and long-term impact on my students’ well-being.</p>
                <p>My journey to becoming a health educator actually began many years ago, when I received a Masters Degree in Education from Harvard University and subsequently taught middle school English for two years at a small, independent school in Massachusetts. I took time off from teaching to work in a community for people with disabilities, then spent a number of joyful and busy years as a stay-at-home mom to my three sons. It was my experience in parenting that ultimately led me to the field of health. One of my children struggled with significant sensory challenges and anxiety in his early years and I realized that I would need to make a serious commitment to the health of my whole family in order to support my son. I spent a great deal of time studying health topics ranging from nutrition to stress management and was delighted that when I was ready to return to work, I was able to find an education-oriented role as the Community Health Coordinator for a local health nonprofit. My two years at Health Connections provided wonderful opportunities to dig deeper into the field of health and allowed me to do everything from teaching cooking classes at elementary schools to leading smoking cessation groups for adults. The more I worked with children, the more I knew that I wanted to return to the classroom on a regular basis, where I could cultivate relationships with students and help them learn about, value, and practice good health. Needless to say, I leapt at the opportunity to teach health in Bethel and I absolutely love the work I do!</p>
                <p>I believe passionately in the importance of providing students with health education from an early age. The skills and functional knowledge that children develop during health class can have an enormous positive impact, not simply on their childhood, but on the choices they make as adults. Ultimately, I believe that health educators can play an important role in helping children to be healthy and happy so that they can learn in school and thrive in life--what a wonderful job!</p>
                <p>The process of working toward my license has been an arduous but powerful learning experience for me. Compiling this portfolio allowed me ample opportunities to reflect on my practice--it helped me see my strengths as well as nudge me toward improvement in my weakest areas. I consider myself a better educator because of the work I have done to earn my license and I plan to seek out more courses and workshops so that I can continue my professional growth. I am grateful for your time in reviewing my work and I look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Laurie Smith</p>

            Although I worked in the field of public health for two years prior to beginning my current role as an Elementary Health Educator, I have been taking health courses since September 2016 to strengthen my knowledge base and improve my understanding of best practices in health education. During this time, I completed coursework in Nutrition and Food Education, Principles and Methods for Effective Health Education, Human Biology, and Concepts in Personal and Community Health for Educators. I also completed CPR, AED, and First Aid Training through the American Red Cross. In addition, I attended two skills-based health education workshops and participated in an online puberty workshop.

          <div class="panel-body">
            Throughout my professional life, both in work and volunteer capacities, I have made clear, thoughtful, and respectful communication a high priority. As a Health Educator, I ensure that families understand what their children are learning in class by creating and sending home topical flyers as well as report card letters that detail our health studies. I am sensitive to the fact that many of my students’ family members may never have taken a health class and are not highly educated; I make an effort to craft simple but important messages in hopes of educating parents as well as informing them about what their children are learning during health class.
            <br /><br /> In my role as a member of the South Royalton School Board for four years, I had ample opportunities to develop my writing and speaking skills. Working with board colleagues, I took the lead in creating powerpoint slides each winter which I presented to the community at our Annual School Meeting and Budget Vote before Town Meeting Day. I also chaired the Communications Committee of our SU Transition Board (Orange Windsor and Windsor Northwest Supervisory Unions merged in 2015-16) which involved leading monthly meetings, writing newsletters, and speaking regularly in large public meetings to update local communities on the status of our transition.
            <br /><br /> While I consider my language skills a strength, I also rely regularly on math skills and creative thinking as a health teacher. Whether calculating heart rates or scanning the daily recommendations on a nutrition facts labels, I believe there are many ways to incorporate math into health lessons. One of my favorite lessons involves teaching about sugar and allowing students to calculate and measure the teaspoons of sugar in a food, then determine the total sugar they might consume in a day (it is always a shock to see the sugar add up!)
            <br /><br /> As a health teacher, I especially enjoy finding creative approaches to the topics we are exploring. For example, rather than simply talking about the importance or sleep or completing a coloring page, I worked with preschoolers to build a list of good sleep habits, then gave each student a puppet, blanket, books, and other materials to practice putting a puppet to bed.
            <br /><br />I also try to extend student learning--and promote healthy behavior--by making creative use of the bulletin board space right outside my office. Because my space in uniquely situated in a thoroughfare that students and staff pass many times each day, I try to design engaging and educational boards that show off student work and also get people thinking. For example, when our school participated in Walk at Lunch Day, I devoted preschool-2nd grade class time to better understanding the physical benefits of walking, then had students create personalized footprints about why they like to walk. The resulting bulletin board was a somewhat zany path of footsteps that attracted quite a bit of attention from students and adults and offered a creative chance for me to promote healthy behavior.

                      As a preschool through sixth grade teacher, I see ample evidence of children’s developmental differences every school day. One of the fun but challenging aspects of my job is to toggle between six year-olds, who whisper, “yeah! Health time!” as I approach their classroom, and twelve year-olds, who demand to know whether class will be “fun today” when I arrive.
                      <br /><br /> A constant throughout my curriculum at every grade level is significant time devoted to nutrition education. As such, nutrition is perhaps the best way for me to demonstrate my understanding of child development. While nutrition at the preschool level is very concrete with MyPlate characters and lots of play foods to touch, first and second graders enjoy trying new foods and even competing among classes to eat the most fruits and veggies. At the third and fourth grade level, students are ready for more independence and group work to explore foods but still enjoy the hands-on task of measuring sugar and need very clear directions to “connect the dots” of the lesson. Fifth and sixth graders are naturally drawn to socializing and technology, so I provide opportunities for group projects as well as independent computer research relating to nutrition. As my older students’ abstract thinking abilities develop, I challenge them with written reflections that include broad questions like, “what is food? What does it mean to be a healthy eater?” To illustrate how I approach the differing developmental needs of my students, I created a chart that highlights my approach to nutrition across the grade levels (see link below). I am also including MyPlate character cartoons that I use with early elementary students and an essential nutrients project I use with 5th and 6th graders to illustrate developmentally appropriate approaches to nutrition education.
                      <br /><br /> Although I find that students are naturally interested in health because the topic is so personal, they are much more engaged, and learn more deeply, when I design my lessons with children’s developmental needs in mind. Underpinning my approach is the teacher education I received--including courses in psychology, adolescent development, risk and resilience, and learning disabilities--as both an undergraduate at Middlebury College and a graduate student at Harvard Graduate School of Education.

                      Throughout my professional life, I have had the privilege of working with diverse groups of individuals who possess many unique gifts but also face significant challenges. After college, I spent four years living and working with developmentally disabled adults in the L’Arche Tahoma Hope Community in Tacoma, Washington. This was an enormously formative experience for me and shaped how I see people--as unique and dignified individuals with much to offer and with deeply personal needs and struggles that should be respected.
                      <br /><br /> At the beginning of my teaching career, I worked at the Hillside School in Marlborough Massachusetts, a private middle school for boys who have struggled to find success in traditional school settings. My students faced a variety of challenges, from learning disabilities to attachment disorders, anxiety to Asperger’s syndrome. As an English teacher, coach, and dorm parent, I sought to help my students grow by both supporting their unique needs and challenging them to improve continuously.
                      <br /><br /> When I moved on to work in the field of public health at Health Connections of the Upper Valley, I had the opportunity to lead nutrition, tobacco use prevention, and cooking classes at nine local schools, which gave me the chance to work with students from a variety of backgrounds. In that role, I also worked with diverse populations as a Tobacco Treatment Specialist leading Fresh Start smoking cessation courses for adults. To support my work with people from so many age groups and backgrounds, I participated in Cultural Competency Training.
                      <br /><br /> Now that I teach health, my respect has only grown for the individual gifts my students possess and challenges they face. One of the great privileges of teaching health is working with students in a field that is so deeply personal and meaningful to them. Regardless of whether my students excel in school or will never attend college, a strong foundation in health skills is relevant and important for their life. In addition to meeting regularly with classroom teachers to discuss student needs and concerns, I also work closely with paraprofessionals who remain in the classroom with students as I teach. I build lessons to ensure that multiple modes of learning are taken into account--for example, in 3/4 classes, we began by ripping paper “bacteria” and “immune cells” to simulate immune response, then moved on to a role play about the chain of infection, and spent the remainder of class in pair work brainstorming examples for each element of the infection chain. My units always involve a variety of activities to ensure that every student can access the material, develop skills, and grow in understanding.
                      <br /><br /> I also make an effort to differentiate work according to my students’ needs. For example, when I expected that an assessment project about our immune system studies was too complex for a particular student, I met with his one-on-one aide ahead of time and we planned a strategy for how she could support his work. The student was able to verbally explain what he learned in the unit and, with the help of the aide, was able to copy down his responses and complete the project. He was so proud of his project that he reminded me several times to make sure I posted it on the bulletin board outside my office!

                      My work at Health Connections of the Upper Valley provided me with the opportunity to teach in nine different schools in my region. As I led health lessons in different environments, I began to track which schools seemed most successful at engaging and supporting students and creating a positive culture for learning. A positive, supportive school climate is extremely important to me as an educator--I believe that children learn best and are able to truly thrive when we highlight their strengths, focus on the positive, and set clear expectations. Fortunately, one of the schools that most impressed me was Bethel Elementary because of their MTSS-B (formerly PBIS) program. I was thrilled when Bethel posted an opening for an elementary health educator and have truly loved working there.
                      <br /><br /> I joined Bethel’s MTSS-B team at the start of the 2016-17 school year in hopes of learning about and contributing to this important program. MTSS-B at Bethel truly is “multi-tiered.” While individual classroom teachers create rewards and behavior management systems that best meet their students’ needs, all elementary teachers award paper “buzz bucks” to students whenever they exemplify the school values of respect, responsibility, and safety. The MTSS-B team also organizes monthly assemblies that focus on a “character trait of the month” and distribute awards. In addition, the team is responsible for organizing monthly “Community Builders” for the entire school, including Fall Hike Day and school spirit weeks. One Community Builder I spearheaded was the “Treats for Troops” program, which involved students donating unwanted Halloween candy to go in care packages for members of the military. Working closely with school administration and classroom teachers, I led classes across all grade levels on the effects of sugar, then followed up with a presentation about the Treats for Troops program. Students donated candy the week following Halloween and the youngest grades also created pictures and thank you notes for service members. At the end of the collection week, the nurse and I weighed the donations and I took 46 pounds of candy to a local Treats for Troops drop off station!
                      <br /><br /> Within my own classroom, I utilize our “buzz buck” system by distributing special papers at the end of class where I note the student’s’ impressive behavior, whether it be great focus, helping a friend, or working through a challenging task. In addition, this year I have worked with 3rd-6th grade groups on developing a classroom culture that is Supportive, Authentic, Fun, and where Everyone contributes. Students brainstormed components of each term at the start of the year and I refer back to them frequently to build and maintain a positive culture in my classes.

                      One of my favorite parts of being a teacher is finding creative ways to engage my students in meaningful topics. Although few elementary students possess a sophisticated understanding of healthy behavior, almost all are familiar with basics directives like, “eat your veggies,” “drink lots of water,” and “wear a seatbelt.” Of course, knowing the statement and practicing the behavior are two very different things! As much as possible, I try to help students dig into the “why” and “how” behind common health prescriptions. Why do we need veggies? Why does our body need so much water? How do seatbelts even work? As I design lessons, I aim to help students see topics from a different angle in hopes that what their work will resonate beyond simple health slogans. For example, instead of simply telling students to drink a lot of water, our lesson focused on how much water is actually in living things. Activities included guessing the water content of a carrot, breathing into plastic cups to observe water in our breath, drawing “watery” body parts, and coloring the quantity of water students guessed was in different bodily organs.
                      <br /><br /> The lesson wrapped up with a discussion of needing to replenish all our water-filled parts by drinking water every day. Using grant funding from a WSCC grant, I was able to provide a new water bottle to every student to help them translate the lesson into the health-enhancing skill of keeping hydrated at school. This lesson was such a hit with my youngest students that I decided to take a risk and lead the exact same lesson with my 5th and 6th graders, crayons and all. The class went extremely well and I was delighted to see students across every grade level toting their new water bottles around school and keeping them at their desks. While using a single lesson for preschool through sixth grade is an exception, it was a reminder to me that thinking outside the box with lesson plans can help engage students and deepen their understanding, moving them beyond simple slogans and toward informed, healthy decision-making.
                      <br /><br /> In addition to the water lesson plan just described, I am including a photo of an activity in which students “acted out” digestion with newspapers, pennies, a spray bottle and a few other tools. I am also including pictures from a seat belt safety class for first and second graders, which involved learning Newton’s law that objects in motion tend to stay in motion, practicing the theory by playing Red Light, Green light, and, finally, demonstrating how seat belts keep bodies from moving by simulating a Lego “crash” with and without seat belts in place. These photos demonstrate my commitment to teaching highly engaging health classes to maximize student learning and acquisition of skills.

                      Although I took a number of teacher education courses in college and graduate school, the field of health is a relatively new discipline for me and I had only worked in public health for two years prior to beginning my current job. To ensure that I work from a solid foundation of health knowledge and understand best practices, I have taken courses continuously since returning to teaching. Content classes such as Nutrition and Food Education and Human Biology have enabled me to expand my depth of knowledge and delve more deeply into two of the subjects I teach most often--food and the human body. Principles and Methods of Effective Health Education and the workshops, “All About Those Skills” and “Designing and Implementing a Skills-Based Approach to Health Education” were pivotal in helping me understand the skills-based approach to health. Using what I learned from both of those experiences, I worked with my middle and high school health counterpart over the summer to develop a comprehensive, preK-12th grade curriculum for skills-based health. With the support of our administration, we developed the first comprehensive curriculum in our area and have shared it with colleagues across our SU in hopes of strengthening health programs in all our schools. Additionally, in the fall of 2017, I participated in an online puberty education workshop offered by the Answer program at Rutgers University and completed the course Concepts in Personal and Community Health for Educators through Castleton University.
                      <br /><br /> At times during the past year, it has been challenging to manage coursework as I am re-adjusting to teaching. Fortunately, all of these courses and workshops have provided important background knowledge, excellent opportunities for self-reflection, and helpful tools to improve my teaching practice.

                      As the Community Outreach Coordinator for Health Connections, I was fortunate to have opportunities to teach students as well as lead them in school and community advocacy efforts related to tobacco prevention. At South Royalton School, I worked with the Students Against Destructive Decisions (S.A.D.D.) group to spearhead a smoking ban on the town green and playing fields. Students in the group had already attended my lessons called “Tobacco 101” and “E-Cigarettes: The Myths and the Facts.” Over the course of four months, I attended weekly S.A.D.D. meetings to help students deepen their understanding of tobacco use in public spaces and guide them through their advocacy project. It was important for the students to take ownership of the process--with me serving as a support and technical advisor--and they spent several weeks debating what the plan should entail. Students decided to create a petition for their smoking ban and gathered signatures from other students, teachers, and members of the community. We also brought the school’s fifth grade class into the process by engaging them in a green clean up activity which--to the students’ disgust--collected 788 cigarette butts in 30 minutes! I then worked with S.A.D.D. students to develop a presentation for Royalton’s Selectboard. This involved a significant time commitment from students, who had to truly master tobacco information to insure they gave a well-informed presentation and were able to answer questions. Ultimately, they created a display of the many harmful ingredients in a cigarette and a powerpoint about the effects of secondhand smoke, then invited fifth graders to bring their jars of collected cigarette butts and speak to the Selectboard about their experience cleaning the green. All the students involved were bitterly disappointed when the Selectboard narrowly defeated their proposal. It was a difficult lesson in how slowly change occurs and how advocacy efforts must be sustained. Although I transitioned jobs shortly after, South Royalton’s new VKAT group took up the issue the following year and I volunteered to continue supporting the effort. In June of 2017, armed with a fresh powerpoint and presenting to a newly-constituted board, the smoking ban passed and will soon become an ordinance in Royalton! As I reflected on this long and sometimes frustrating experience, I was enormously proud of the students for their hard work and tenacity and I also realized that the opportunity to advocate--to create a real-life solution for a community problem--had led them from basic knowledge of to proficiency in understanding tobacco issues.
                      <br /><br /> Another chance I had to lead students to a deeper understanding of important issues involved working with 7th graders in Bethel on “Kick Butts Day” initiatives. Kick Butts Day is a nation-wide day of student advocacy to reduce tobacco use and draw attention to the harmful effects of tobacco. After leading tobacco education classes with students, I helped them comb through actual memos from tobacco companies that discussed marketing to youth. Students chose quotes they found alarming (such as, “young people are our best source of replacement smokers”) and copied them onto t-shirts, which we then displayed on a clothesline erected in the school’s main lobby. To personalize the effort, the seventh graders wrote “selfie statements” that proclaimed, “I am not a replacement [smoker], I am . . .” We mounted the statements around the students’ clothesline and also took photos which were uploaded to the Kick Butts Day website along with hundreds of others from students across the country. Although this effort was not as involved as my work with S.A.D.D. students, it provided an important opportunity for students to translate their knowledge into action, deepen their understanding of tobacco issues, and serve as teachers for the school and community.

In many ways, the movement of e-cigarettes into the mainstream over the last several years parallels how traditional cigarettes came into common use decades ago--they were both branded as safe and even beneficial, promoted as cool, endorsed by celebrities, and marketed as a bold way to proclaim personal freedom. In teaching about e-cigarettes, I realized that I would need to go much deeper into issues of safety, marketing, and even how one breaks an addiction to help students truly understand this complex issue. To do this, I created a lesson that grouped students and required them to take a position on the key “pro” and “con” arguments about using e-cigarettes, then hold an actual debate in class. The debate was part science lesson, part persuasive speaking practice, and part critical thinking. While many fifth and sixth graders found the exercise challenging, especially when they had to defend a point of view they did not believe in, the debate was a powerful way to break open the topic and help students appreciate the complexity of the issues.
                      <br /><br /> As much as possible in my health classes, I try to build lessons around real world issues and authentic concerns that children have. Whether we are learning about tobacco or seatbelt safety, it is important to me that students connect their health classes to their life and the world around them. Adopting a skills-based approach to health education is helpful in this regard because it allows students to translate skills not only to their lived experience but to other subjects they study at school. For example, as I developed a unit for 5th and 6th graders on accessing valid health information, I also introduced classroom teachers to the R.A.C.E. skill steps and provided them with a laminated copy of the steps to post in their room. I taught the initial skill early in the school year and provided practice for students by having them conduct internet health research about breakfast and a topic of their choosing. In addition to applying the R.A.C.E. steps in health class throughout the year, students will also be able to use them as a guide for research in every course.
                      <br /><br /> For me, the skills-based approach to health education is all about making connections-- connections between content and real-life as well as connections between the different subjects at school. The skills outlined in the National Health Education Standards go much further than promoting health, they actually empower students with tools they need across disciplines and in different parts of their lives. I am still very much a novice at helping students develop skills but I am eager to refine my units and collaborate more with my peers to grow the skills-based approach across our curriculum.

                      As previously noted, my role as a Community Outreach Coordinator enabled me to work with students on a variety of community tobacco advocacy projects, including a smoking ban led by students and a Kick Butts Day initiative that educated the school and community about tobacco marketing to youth. I also had the chance to participate in another Kick Butts Day project at White River Elementary School that involved students writing tobacco messages along their playground fence line and in chalk in front of the school. As with other advocacy projects, students first participated in several tobacco education lessons to ensure a strong base of functional information. Next, they chose the messages they most wanted their families to see and sketched out ways to turn their powerful facts into lessons that would resonate with adults. One particularly interesting facet of the project was helping students decide which messages were most striking and which might be too controversial. Although students were only in fourth and fifth grade, we had lively discussions about questions like, “what do people most need to know about tobacco?” and “how can we tell the truth without scaring people?” As students participate in health advocacy efforts, they also practice collaboration, creative problem solving, and build communication skills.
                      <br /><br /> In my role as a health teacher, I try to connect my lessons to authentic issues whenever possible. Although it is important for students to link their studies to their own health, I believe it is equally valuable for them to connect lessons with issues that impact the local and global community. To find an more consistent forum to make these connections, I began a Vermont Kids Against Tobacco (VKAT) chapter at Bethel Elementary in the fall of 2017. More than half the fifth and sixth grade joined the group, which demonstrates students’ eagerness to learn and lead on meaningful issues. Currently, our group meets during lunch once a week. Students recently received training at the annual Youth Summit, and we will soon embark on a “photo voice” project that documents some of the values held by the Bethel community as well as how tobacco companies try to lure children to experiment with their products. VKAT offers students the chance to build their self-esteem while engaging in important advocacy work--it is truly a joy to lead the group and I look forward to seeing the project they create.

                      I use a variety of assessment techniques to help gauge what my students know and are able to do, as well as how they are progressing in their learning. Assessments are important both in helping me understand my students and reflecting upon my own teaching. I often employ simple formative assessments at the start of units, such as asking students to write out a separate sticky note for everything they know about accessing valid health information online. I collect these bits of knowledge and place them on a poster that I bring to class throughout a unit. The notes help guide my planning because they serve as an easy visual reference of what students already know (or perhaps are wrong about). They also provide a fun conclusion to our studies because students enjoy revisiting them, adding new understanding and correcting their mistakes.
                      <br /><br /> In the midst of units, I rely on different formative assessments to gauge student understanding and progress. I may use exit tickets or written reflection questions to provide quick insight into what each student is learning. I also like to utilize games to assess learning. For example, when we are working on nutrition, students at every grade level seem to love food flash cards and I have designed different games that give insight into their progress on a given food topic. In addition to helping me understand the progress of each student, these mid-unit formative assessments provide me with critical feedback about how I may need to adjust my teaching to be more clear or to better challenge students.
                      <br /><br /> For summative assessments at the end of units, I generally ask students to complete a project or craft, as well as a written reflection about their work (for the older grades). I am also working to incorporate performance assessments into my classes so that I can watch students actually do the skill we have studied and provide feedback. For example, at the end of a self-management unit that involved learning about the immune system and practicing illness-avoiding behaviors, students completed a project that required them to write a “care label” tag like the ones that appear on clothes to show how to care for their body. They were given materials to review their learning and had parameters to follow as well as freedom to make their work creative and funny. Many students found the project challenging because it required them to communicate in an unusual way, using brief, clear, declarative statements. Once they got the hang of the project, though, they enjoyed the process and were proud to see their work displayed on my bulletin board, which is in the main thoroughfare of the elementary school. I paired this project with a performance assessment involving proper hand washing techniques and using “glo-germ” lotion to gauge students’ success. By assigning both a project and a performance assessment, I was able to assess both what my students had learned in the unit and what they were able to do as a result of our studies.

                      One of the challenges associated with meaningful student assessment is making sure it is always conducted in an ethical manner. In addition to designing formative and summative assessments that genuinely allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, I believe it is also important to ensure that I assess each student fairly and honestly address any biases or blind spots I may have. For example, it is easy for expectations of a particular student to cloud a teacher’s judgement of their learning. With my students who have disabilities, I make an effort to assess them fairly regardless of whether they complete the same work as their peers or I have differentiated their assignments. My students with significant academic or behavioral challenges frequently have one-on-one aides who remain with them during health. Before I have students begin work on an assessment, I meet with the aide privately to create an assessment plan for their student. I work closely with aides to adapt assessments to insure that they reflect student learning as well as safeguard children’s dignity. With input from the aide, I modify the assessment and we also make an implementation plan to insure that we both understand how the student will be supported during class time. I try to make sure that I am also sensitive to students’ sense of self-worth in this process. For example, if I allow a student to skip a project, she may feel left out of a fun activity that her peers can do. Likewise, expecting a student with a disability to participate in a role play can be overwhelming because the assessment takes too public a form. Ultimately, I make an effort to assess my students as fairly as possible, while differentiating as needed and working closely with aides and other teachers to best meet student needs.
                      <br /><br /> An element of assessment ethics that is especially important in the health is privacy. Because health class provides many opportunities to explore highly personal topics, it is important to me that students know that I respect their privacy. I work to build a respectful learning community from the beginning of the year and I make an effort to keep my commitments to students to show that I am trustworthy. I am clear with students about the sort of information that I can keep confidential (for example, feeling scared to fall asleep at night) and also the issues I am required to share with others (such as abuse in the home). Students in my classes know that they are never required to share personal information and I try to offer opportunities for them to practice honest self-assessment that they will not have to give to me. When I worked with third and fourth graders on hygiene, for example, I gave them an opportunity to take a self-assessment to judge how they are doing with personal hygiene practices. At their request, I allowed students to set up privacy screens as they wrote their answers. Because the topic made many students uncomfortable, I kept my commitment not to read their answers by giving them the choice of taking the assessments home or watching me shred them and put them in a trash (which I tied up before leaving the room). Although a few students were eager to show me their work (naturally, these were the ones with the best hygiene practices), I believe that students took the assessment more seriously and learned more from it because I made a genuine effort to respect their privacy.

                      One of the many benefits of my current work is that I teach at a preK-12th grade school and work closely with my colleague who teaches at the middle and high school level. We were fortunate to take our nutrition class as well as the Principles & Methods for Effective Health Education course together. We each grew excited as we learned more about the skills-based approach to teaching health, but we realized it would take a significant amount of work to do it well! Fortunately, we have a very supportive administration who funded our summer work to create a comprehensive, preK-12th grade scope and sequence for health at our school. During the 2017-18 academic year, we are piloting the shift to a skills-based program and testing the strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum map we created. Although we are not even a full term into this school year, we have already noted areas where we were overly ambitious in our plans and have also found issues crop up with students that we believe we need to work into our scope and sequence. We hope to work next summer on fine-tuning our curriculum to ensure that our program is rigorous, relevant, and skill-based while also supporting the shift to proficiency-based graduation requirements.
                      <br /><br /> As part of our SU’s school-based tobacco grant, I also led a group of health teachers through the HECAT tobacco module to ensure that we are consistently and adequately addressing tobacco education throughout the White River Valley Supervisory Union. We are currently working on our scope and sequence for tobacco education and hope to use this effort as a pilot for coordinating health curricula across the SU. One key element of our work has been to shift our teaching mindset away from the content we “cover” and towards the skills our students demonstrate. Although I am still adapting to the skills-based approach, I am gaining confidence, designing more thorough units to meet standards, and feeling extremely proud of my students growing skills!

                      I appreciate assessments both for what they tell me about student learning and what they tell me about my own teaching, as well as how they guide my lesson planning. I often create unit plans more like sketches than firm blueprints to insure that I can adapt lessons as necessary. For example, when I worked with third and fourth graders on body systems and we began the unit with digestion, I used two formative assessments in the first lesson. First, holding a rope we divided into 1 foot lengths to measure the roughly 20 feet of a small intestine, students were asked to name one fact about digestion that they already knew. After we stretched the rope across the room and marveled at the length of our intestines, students watched a video from Kids’ Health about digestion. During the video, I made notes about what students had said about digestion. When the video was complete, students took the quiz provided by Kids’ Health, first individually and then on pieces of paper. After class, I used both my notes and the quizzes to plan subsequent lessons. One of my objectives for the unit was for students to understand that during digestion our body extracts the nutrients we need to grow are be healthy. Although I was not worried about students naming each digestive organ, the formative assessments made it clear to me that they did not grasp the basic process and purpose of digestion. Once I identified these gaps, I adapted a hands-on digestion activity that involved students pairing up and acting out the functions of each part of the digestive system, in order. Following this lesson, I had students repeat the brief quiz from Kid’s Health and also complete exit tickets check their progress. When I was satisfied that students grasped the material better, we moved on to learning about the role of fiber in digestion.
                      <br /><br /> While organization is certainly a critical skill for all teachers possess, I believe that flexibility is just as important. I try to make sure that we move through the curriculum swiftly enough that students do not get bored, but it is also important that I am not bound by artificial timelines or focused simply on “getting through” the material. When I attempted my first thoroughly skills- based unit, I worked with 5th and 6th graders on analyzing influences. The content focus for the unit was alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco, which I worked with our SAP counselor to identify as key ATOD issues for Bethel students based on our most recent YRBS data. When we began the section about drugs, I assured students that their questions would set our pace. I had developed a powerpoint which I assumed would take one or two classes. Students were required to take notes during the presentation and include questions they had that we hadn’t addressed during class. I collected their notes after each lesson, reviewed them, and made comments. This provided a really useful formative assessment that let me clarify misconceptions and address lingering questions. Ultimately, we spent four classes on the presentation because students had so many questions. Instead of being bored by our deep dive into the subject, they expressed gratitude that we spent so much time considering all the questions they had.

                      To insure that health class is meaningful and relevant for students, I collaborate with my colleagues whenever I can. In addition to meeting regularly with my health counterpart in the middle and high school, I also work with classroom teachers, the guidance counselor, the food service director, administration, and the school nurse to plan lessons that will meet my students’ needs. I encourage all of my colleagues to come to me when they have a health concern, either for an entire class or for a particular student and, whenever possible, I try to respond to their requests promptly.
                      <br /><br /> In the spring of 2017, our school nurse approached me to share a concern about the number of ticks she was pulling off students after recess. We made a plan that included me contacting our school nurse liaison at the Department of Health for resources, reaching out to administration to get lingering playground leaves removed, teaching tick lessons in every elementary class, and creating a simple educational flyer that went home with every student and was sent to staff members. The nurse and I spoke about tick concerns at a faculty meeting and made sure to show staff a protocol to follow when a student had a tick, as well as how they should remove ticks from themselves. Our message was basically, “don’t panic but do take this seriously. Here’s what you can do . . .” By working together, the nurse and I were able to address an important issue very quickly and help students and adults develop the skills to check for, recognize, and remove ticks. We were gratified to hear students of all ages saying, “hang on, I need to do a tick check” when they came in from recess!
                      <br /><br /> Another exciting avenue for collaboration for me is working with the after school program. Because they have more flexibility and longer stretches of time with students, the after school program can be really creative. In the fall of 2017, they partnered with the organization Local Motion to provide a bike trailer for students to ride bikes after school. I connected with Local Motion and invited one of their educators to visit all of my classes and teach about bike helmets. The organization also generously donated more than 40 helmets to students in need at our school, which was a wonderful and important follow up to the safety lesson. Having been a traveling classroom presenter myself for several years as I worked for Health Connections of the Upper Valley, I can attest to the fact that elementary students enthusiastically welcome guests and are eager to learn from outside experts. Whenever possible, I try to utilize guest speakers in my classes to provide more depth about a subject and also offer new perspectives. In this way, collaboration within the school and with the community can really enrich the health curriculum and improve student learning.

                      Elementary health education is a field that lends itself easily to creative, engaging instructional approaches because everything from science experiments to cooking to written self-reflection fits easily within the curriculum. I design all of my units to include a variety of instructional approaches to ensure that every student can learn the skills and content, to deepen understanding, and to keep students engaged in what we are studying. In any given week’s worth of classes, I am likely to have students do a science experiment (such as dispersing oil with soap when we learn about hand washing), complete a written reflection, play a review game (like Kahoot or MyPlate Jeopardy), create and share a role play as a group, conduct internet research, or design a nutritious meal plan for several days. Teaching 4 through 12 year-olds means that I encounter all sorts of learning styles and I make an effort to mix individual and group work as well as to support different learning styles such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners. Building relationships with students and understanding how they learn is also an important element of developing lessons. Because I teach several different groups at the same age level (for example, I lead 3 classes of 1st and 2nd graders each week), I also adapt instructional strategies for the specific needs of the group. For example, some of my youngest students learn best when they collaborate, while others simply goof around, so I build a group and individual work variation into my lessons to best meet the needs of each class.
                      <br /><br /> One example of using multiple instructional strategies was the unit I designed for fifth and sixth graders about analyzing influences. This involved a fun activity where students tried to influence a group of peer volunteers to switch “mystery bags,” as well as studying different styles of influence, reflecting on how their personalities and values influence them, taking notes on a powerpoint about drugs and alcohol, discussing drug and alcohol use as a class, watching the video, “The Truth About Drugs,” applying their influence analysis skills to real people in the video, and designing and performing role plays about influence. The unit was quite long but allowed us to explore the skill and content in depth. Based on student assessments, I believe students made significant gains in their ability to analyze influences as well as in their understanding of how drugs, alcohol, and marijuana affect the brain. I think that including so many different instructional methods in the unit allowed for the depth of learning that took place--I believe I would have lost students very early on if each class required them to complete the same type of work throughout the unit..
                      <br /><br /> A simpler example of varying instructional strategies is the safety lesson I taught preschool and kindergartners about wearing seat belts. Knowing that all of my students already knew the “right answer” that they should always wear seat belts, I decided to go deeper into the science of how seat belts work. First, we played “Red Light, Green Light,” with half the class assigned to be observers watching what happened to their classmates bodies when they had to stop for a red light. After giving all the students a chance to play the game and observe, I introduced Newton’s first law of motion and students made predictions about how it would relate to a person in a car. Using a makeshift road, a Pinewood derby car, and a Lego man, we simulated accident scenes, both with and without a seatbelt for our Lego. Once we saw that a seatbelt could, in fact, restrain the Lego man in a “crash,” we used straps to explore proper seat belt fit and the possible outcomes if a seatbelt was worn incorrectly. Although the crash simulation certainly excited my young students, I think that the physical experience of lurching forward during “Red Light, Green Light” was what really helped deepen their understanding of how seat belts work.

                      Since taking the Principles and Methods for Effective Health Education course in early 2017, I have been transitioning to a skills-based approach to health. I attempted several skills-based units toward the end of the school year, then worked with my middle and high school counterpart to design a comprehensive scope and sequence for skills-based health education at our school. One of my first attempts at teaching skills was unsuccessful but provided a very useful learning experience for me. I designed a unit about communication by hewing very closely to the textbook guidelines from my methods course. I introduced the skill cue “ITELL” and modeled the simple script, “I feel . . . when . . . because . . . Next time . . .” Students worked in pairs and had the opportunity to practice communicating about topics of their own choosing as well as ones I had assigned. Although their practice went well and students engaged in some thoughtful and powerful discussions about asthma, I discovered during the summative assessment that they had not come close to mastering the skill! Without me providing a significant amount of scaffolding for the skill, they were unable to transfer the communication skills I had taught.
                      <br /><br /> Fortunately, I had the opportunity to reflect on my mistakes over the summer and I re-designed the unit to improve outcomes. One major error I identified in my initial unit was a lack of authenticity. Of course, it is much easier to follow communications skill cues in a staged scenario than in a real situation where emotions are at play! To insure that students truly learned the communications skills I taught, had authentic opportunities for practice, and also learned the unit’s content deeply, I created a lengthy unit where third and fourth grade classes worked collaboratively to design the menu for a “kid’s cafe.” The unit included explicit teaching about communications skills but, critically, also required authentic communication opportunities. Because students were invested in their project (they were ultimately required to design a single menu for the cafe that met a number of nutritional requirements) and we highlighted communications skills throughout the unit, they demonstrated much more growth than in the less authentic lesson of the previous year. In the future, I hope to create more long term projects, especially for older students, that interweave authentic skills practice with deep exploration of content.

                      I began my role as a health educator at Bethel Elementary keenly aware that I had a lot to learn! Because health represented a discipline and age change from my work early in my career as a middle school English teacher, I have made an effort to take as many courses as possible to improve my knowledge base and health teaching skills. I have taken college or graduate courses continuously since starting at Bethel, as well as participated in several workshops and have found this professional development to be extremely helpful in my growth as a teacher. In addition to my Castleton and CCV transcripts and sample coursework, I am including my long term professional development plan as evidence because it demonstrates my commitment to continued growth and improvement as a health educator. Although it has been challenging to take so many classes while adjusting to my new job, it has also helped me adopt an open-minded attitude to continuous improvement. I am aware that I’m very much a work-in-progress as a health teacher and I am excited to continue to learn and grow!

                      One of the unique features of my work is that health education had not been offered at Bethel Elementary for a decade prior to my arrival. This means that I have been responsible for re-building the entire health program, a sometimes-daunting but also very exciting process! With support from administration, I have sought ways to create a culture of health throughout our school. One way I have done this is by utilizing data in my decision-making as much as possible. I consider data especially important in the realm of health education because teachers need a realistic sense of health challenges at the individual, local, state, and national level to create programs that are relevant and rigorous. As mentioned previously, I consider assessments a critical piece of data in planning lessons and units. Of course, assessment data is only effective in improving teaching if it is aggregated and analyzed! I try to glean as much “meta” information as possible from my assessments to respond to student needs and strengthen my program, although I have decided that a deeper dive into student work as a summer project may be necessary to identify trends. When I taught cooking classes, I was able to analyze student evaluations to continually improve my program as well as to share useful health information with the after school program. As a health teacher, one example of using evidence to guide my decision making was developing tick safety lessons after the nurse gave me three ticks she removed from students following recess. This lesson had an impact beyond students because I also developed a flyer for families and worked to educate my colleagues about tick safety. A second opportunity to respond to evidence came as I worked on bike safety. As mentioned previously, I had the opportunity to invite a guest speaker to discuss helmets during the week our afterschool program offered afternoon biking as an activity. Around the time I was planning my approach to bike safety, the school-based pediatrician shared a concern about several students from low income families who admitted that they had a bike but could not afford a helmet. The timing was fortuitous and I was able to secure a donation of more than 40 new bike helmets from the nonprofit Local Motion to address student needs. Because the helmet give-away took place in the broader context of bike safety lessons and Local Motion was so generous, we were able to provide helmets for every student who said they regularly ride something with wheels but do not have a helmet. I was especially pleased that needy students could benefit but did not need to be singled out; the pediatrician’s concern inspired me to find a solution to a persistent safety issue faced by many of our students.
                      <br /><br /> Beyond assessments and specific evidence to guide my teaching decisions, I also rely on data from sources such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and Developmental Assets Profile. These help me identify health strengths, challenges, and risks that my students face and I plan my lessons with these in mind. To build our school health program more broadly, our SU was fortunate to receive a school-based tobacco grant which required us to complete the School Health Index during the 2016-2017 school year. Due to my previous work experience, I had the opportunity to lead our school health team through this process. Thanks to a responsive administration, information from our SHI surveys and the goals we identified have become a priority--shortly after we completed our work, vending machines were removed, a new food service manager was hired using input from the health team, and a new school nutrition team began work to improve our food service program.

                      Demonstrating evidence of one’s commitment to ethical behavior is a task perhaps best left to others--after all, it can be difficult to prove!--so I am including discussion threads from my Principles and Methods for Effective Health Education course as well as letters of recommendation to support this competency. I would also like to make a few general comments about professional ethics. First and most importantly, it is extremely important to me to behave in an ethical matter at all times in both my personal and professional life. Honesty, kindness, and respect are bedrock principles that guide my behavior and I strive to infuse them into everything I do. Secondly, while all teachers must take great care to behave ethically with students and colleagues, I believe that teaching health at times requires extra sensitivity to ethics. For example, it is incumbent upon a health educator to speak truthfully about health issues because failing to do so could jeopardize a student’s safety or well-being. At the same time, care must be taken not to alarm students or judge their family’s values. Since many adults are not health literate, it is also important to approach every topic in a respectful manner so that children can contribute to their family’s health rather than simply criticizing other’s choices. From the beginning of my work as a health teacher, I have been upfront with all of my colleagues in admitting that I have much to learn. I regularly seek their input on how to approach certain issues or support individual students. I do not have my own classroom but travel to the rooms of 11 different colleagues, who frequently remain at their desks while I teach. This provides ample opportunity for informal observation and I ask my colleagues to share their insights about my health classes at any time. Although I sometimes feel that I need to work extra hard on classroom management to earn students’ attention and respect when their teacher is just a few feet away, I believe that the feedback I receive from informal observations improves my teaching methods and helps me remain aware of any ethical issues that arise during my classes.

                      I have provided specific evidence of my collaborative approach to teaching elsewhere in this portfolio (such as my tick and bike safety lessons) and would like to address broader examples of collaboration for this competency. I believe that for health education to truly have a positive impact on students--to develop transferable skills, lead to mastery of functional information, and inspire healthy behaviors--health class cannot exist in isolation but must be part of a school’s culture. My hard work in the classroom will not lead far if students never see healthy choices modeled or promoted in the school environment, where they spend so much of their childhood! Because of this, I believe it is incumbent upon me to reach out and collaborate on a school-wide level to promote a culture of health in Bethel Schools. I have collaborated with students outside the classroom by inviting them to join our school nutrition team and by leading our VKAT group; I have collaborated with families by asking them to serve on the SU Wellness Team that I chair as well as on our school health and nutrition teams; I’ve collaborated with colleagues by seeking their ideas, designing interdisciplinary units, and inviting their health input through surveys; I have collaborated across my SU on the wellness team and tobacco grant; and I have collaborated with community members by organizing guest speakers on topics from asthma to mindfulness and spearheading the Treats for Troops program. There are so many wonderful health resources within the school and the community that I find collaboration to be both enjoyable and fruitful. As I get to know Bethel Elementary and the broader community better, I look forward to deepening my collaborative efforts for the sake of student learning and health promotion.

                      My work as a Community Outreach Coordinator for Health Connections of the Upper Valley helped me develop leadership skills which I use regularly in my role at Bethel Elementary. The Outreach Coordinator position was flexible and unstructured--I was essentially given a list of schools where I was expected to teach nutrition, cooking, and tobacco education and left to my own devices. I was also asked write grants and serve on committees, sometimes as their leader. I did a great deal of research to build my curriculum, reached out to set up classes and meetings, fine-tuned my organizational skills to juggle my varied responsibilities, and had many opportunities to develop both my writing and speaking skills. This baptism-by-fire type experience at Health Connections provided with with the skills and confidence to serve as a leader in the school where I now teach. In 2015, I wrote WRVSU’s Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child grant and served as coordinator after the grant was awarded, a role that included convening and leading our SU’s Wellness Committee, leading the development of a new SU wellness policy, developing and overseeing implementation of SU wellness goals, and ensuring that grant funds were spent to improve wellness at the 8 WRVSU schools. I am particularly proud to have led a subcommittee of WRVSU’s Wellness Team that re-wrote our Wellness Policy--the revised policy is far more robust than previous versions and includes strong support for health and wellness, including a statement that recess will not be taken away from students as a punishment for missed homework or poor behavior. While I find policy level work somewhat dry, I do believe it has a true impact on students and I learned a great deal in the complex process of re-writing our policy. Our entire Wellness Team was very pleased when every school board in our SU adopted the policy without making any changes! Although the WSCC grant is complete, I continue to lead our SU’s Wellness Team in my current job as a health teacher.
                      <br /><br /> Since coming to Bethel Elementary, I have also served as leader of Bethel’s School Health Index process, our School Nutrition Team, and our VKAT club. Although it was an enormous logistical effort to lead our School Health Team through the elementary and middle/high school portions of the School Health Index during the 2016-17 school year, it helped reveal our strengths and critical needs and led to the development of important health-related goals. I try to safeguard my own health and avoid saying “yes” to every committee or leadership opportunity that appears, but I genuinely enjoy making positive contributions to my school community and I plan to continue in leadership roles that benefit my students, school, and SU.
