            Although I worked in the field of public health for two years prior to beginning my current role as an Elementary Health Educator, I have been taking health courses since September 2016 to strengthen my knowledge base and improve my understanding of best practices in health education. During this time, I completed coursework in Nutrition and Food Education, Principles and Methods for Effective Health Education, Human Biology, and Concepts in Personal and Community Health for Educators. I also completed CPR, AED, and First Aid Training through the American Red Cross. In addition, I attended two skills-based health education workshops and participated in an online puberty workshop.

            Throughout my professional life, both in work and volunteer capacities, I have made clear, thoughtful, and respectful communication a high priority. As a Health Educator, I ensure that families understand what their children are learning in class by creating and sending home topical flyers as well as report card letters that detail our health studies. I am sensitive to the fact that many of my students’ family members may never have taken a health class and are not highly educated; I make an effort to craft simple but important messages in hopes of educating parents as well as informing them about what their children are learning during health class.
            <br /><br /> In my role as a member of the South Royalton School Board for four years, I had ample opportunities to develop my writing and speaking skills. Working with board colleagues, I took the lead in creating powerpoint slides each winter which I presented to the community at our Annual School Meeting and Budget Vote before Town Meeting Day. I also chaired the Communications Committee of our SU Transition Board (Orange Windsor and Windsor Northwest Supervisory Unions merged in 2015-16) which involved leading monthly meetings, writing newsletters, and speaking regularly in large public meetings to update local communities on the status of our transition.
            <br /><br /> While I consider my language skills a strength, I also rely regularly on math skills and creative thinking as a health teacher. Whether calculating heart rates or scanning the daily recommendations on a nutrition facts labels, I believe there are many ways to incorporate math into health lessons. One of my favorite lessons involves teaching about sugar and allowing students to calculate and measure the teaspoons of sugar in a food, then determine the total sugar they might consume in a day (it is always a shock to see the sugar add up!)
            <br /><br /> As a health teacher, I especially enjoy finding creative approaches to the topics we are exploring. For example, rather than simply talking about the importance or sleep or completing a coloring page, I worked with preschoolers to build a list of good sleep habits, then gave each student a puppet, blanket, books, and other materials to practice putting a puppet to bed.
            <br /><br />I also try to extend student learning--and promote healthy behavior--by making creative use of the bulletin board space right outside my office. Because my space in uniquely situated in a thoroughfare that students and staff pass many times each day, I try to design engaging and educational boards that show off student work and also get people thinking. For example, when our school participated in Walk at Lunch Day, I devoted preschool-2nd grade class time to better understanding the physical benefits of walking, then had students create personalized footprints about why they like to walk. The resulting bulletin board was a somewhat zany path of footsteps that attracted quite a bit of attention from students and adults and offered a creative chance for me to promote healthy behavior.

                  As a preschool through sixth grade teacher, I see ample evidence of children’s developmental differences every school day. One of the fun but challenging aspects of my job is to toggle between six year-olds, who whisper, “yeah! Health time!” as I approach their classroom, and twelve year-olds, who demand to know whether class will be “fun today” when I arrive.
                  <br /><br /> A constant throughout my curriculum at every grade level is significant time devoted to nutrition education. As such, nutrition is perhaps the best way for me to demonstrate my understanding of child development. While nutrition at the preschool level is very concrete with MyPlate characters and lots of play foods to touch, first and second graders enjoy trying new foods and even competing among classes to eat the most fruits and veggies. At the third and fourth grade level, students are ready for more independence and group work to explore foods but still enjoy the hands-on task of measuring sugar and need very clear directions to “connect the dots” of the lesson. Fifth and sixth graders are naturally drawn to socializing and technology, so I provide opportunities for group projects as well as independent computer research relating to nutrition. As my older students’ abstract thinking abilities develop, I challenge them with written reflections that include broad questions like, “what is food? What does it mean to be a healthy eater?” To illustrate how I approach the differing developmental needs of my students, I created a chart that highlights my approach to nutrition across the grade levels (see link below). I am also including MyPlate character cartoons that I use with early elementary students and an essential nutrients project I use with 5th and 6th graders to illustrate developmentally appropriate approaches to nutrition education.
                  <br /><br /> Although I find that students are naturally interested in health because the topic is so personal, they are much more engaged, and learn more deeply, when I design my lessons with children’s developmental needs in mind. Underpinning my approach is the teacher education I received--including courses in psychology, adolescent development, risk and resilience, and learning disabilities--as both an undergraduate at Middlebury College and a graduate student at Harvard Graduate School of Education.

                <div class="narrative">
                  Throughout my professional life, I have had the privilege of working with diverse groups of individuals who possess many unique gifts but also face significant challenges. After college, I spent four years living and working with developmentally disabled adults in the L’Arche Tahoma Hope Community in Tacoma, Washington. This was an enormously formative experience for me and shaped how I see people--as unique and dignified individuals with much to offer and with deeply personal needs and struggles that should be respected.
                  <br /><br /> At the beginning of my teaching career, I worked at the Hillside School in Marlborough Massachusetts, a private middle school for boys who have struggled to find success in traditional school settings. My students faced a variety of challenges, from learning disabilities to attachment disorders, anxiety to Asperger’s syndrome. As an English teacher, coach, and dorm parent, I sought to help my students grow by both supporting their unique needs and challenging them to improve continuously.
                  <br /><br /> When I moved on to work in the field of public health at Health Connections of the Upper Valley, I had the opportunity to lead nutrition, tobacco use prevention, and cooking classes at nine local schools, which gave me the chance to work with students from a variety of backgrounds. In that role, I also worked with diverse populations as a Tobacco Treatment Specialist leading Fresh Start smoking cessation courses for adults. To support my work with people from so many age groups and backgrounds, I participated in Cultural Competency Training.
                  <br /><br /> Now that I teach health, my respect has only grown for the individual gifts my students possess and challenges they face. One of the great privileges of teaching health is working with students in a field that is so deeply personal and meaningful to them. Regardless of whether my students excel in school or will never attend college, a strong foundation in health skills is relevant and important for their life. In addition to meeting regularly with classroom teachers to discuss student needs and concerns, I also work closely with paraprofessionals who remain in the classroom with students as I teach. I build lessons to ensure that multiple modes of learning are taken into account--for example, in 3/4 classes, we began by ripping paper “bacteria” and “immune cells” to simulate immune response, then moved on to a role play about the chain of infection, and spent the remainder of class in pair work brainstorming examples for each element of the infection chain. My units always involve a variety of activities to ensure that every student can access the material, develop skills, and grow in understanding.
                  <br /><br /> I also make an effort to differentiate work according to my students’ needs. For example, when I expected that an assessment project about our immune system studies was too complex for a particular student, I met with his one-on-one aide ahead of time and we planned a strategy for how she could support his work. The student was able to verbally explain what he learned in the unit and, with the help of the aide, was able to copy down his responses and complete the project. He was so proud of his project that he reminded me several times to make sure I posted it on the bulletin board outside my office!

                  My work at Health Connections of the Upper Valley provided me with the opportunity to teach in nine different schools in my region. As I led health lessons in different environments, I began to track which schools seemed most successful at engaging and supporting students and creating a positive culture for learning. A positive, supportive school climate is extremely important to me as an educator--I believe that children learn best and are able to truly thrive when we highlight their strengths, focus on the positive, and set clear expectations. Fortunately, one of the schools that most impressed me was Bethel Elementary because of their MTSS-B (formerly PBIS) program. I was thrilled when Bethel posted an opening for an elementary health educator and have truly loved working there.
                  <br /><br /> I joined Bethel’s MTSS-B team at the start of the 2016-17 school year in hopes of learning about and contributing to this important program. MTSS-B at Bethel truly is “multi-tiered.” While individual classroom teachers create rewards and behavior management systems that best meet their students’ needs, all elementary teachers award paper “buzz bucks” to students whenever they exemplify the school values of respect, responsibility, and safety. The MTSS-B team also organizes monthly assemblies that focus on a “character trait of the month” and distribute awards. In addition, the team is responsible for organizing monthly “Community Builders” for the entire school, including Fall Hike Day and school spirit weeks. One Community Builder I spearheaded was the “Treats for Troops” program, which involved students donating unwanted Halloween candy to go in care packages for members of the military. Working closely with school administration and classroom teachers, I led classes across all grade levels on the effects of sugar, then followed up with a presentation about the Treats for Troops program. Students donated candy the week following Halloween and the youngest grades also created pictures and thank you notes for service members. At the end of the collection week, the nurse and I weighed the donations and I took 46 pounds of candy to a local Treats for Troops drop off station!
                  <br /><br /> Within my own classroom, I utilize our “buzz buck” system by distributing special papers at the end of class where I note the student’s’ impressive behavior, whether it be great focus, helping a friend, or working through a challenging task. In addition, this year I have worked with 3rd-6th grade groups on developing a classroom culture that is Supportive, Authentic, Fun, and where Everyone contributes. Students brainstormed components of each term at the start of the year and I refer back to them frequently to build and maintain a positive culture in my classes.

                  One of my favorite parts of being a teacher is finding creative ways to engage my students in meaningful topics. Although few elementary students possess a sophisticated understanding of healthy behavior, almost all are familiar with basics directives like, “eat your veggies,” “drink lots of water,” and “wear a seatbelt.” Of course, knowing the statement and practicing the behavior are two very different things! As much as possible, I try to help students dig into the “why” and “how” behind common health prescriptions. Why do we need veggies? Why does our body need so much water? How do seatbelts even work? As I design lessons, I aim to help students see topics from a different angle in hopes that what their work will resonate beyond simple health slogans. For example, instead of simply telling students to drink a lot of water, our lesson focused on how much water is actually in living things. Activities included guessing the water content of a carrot, breathing into plastic cups to observe water in our breath, drawing “watery” body parts, and coloring the quantity of water students guessed was in different bodily organs.
                  <br /><br /> The lesson wrapped up with a discussion of needing to replenish all our water-filled parts by drinking water every day. Using grant funding from a WSCC grant, I was able to provide a new water bottle to every student to help them translate the lesson into the health-enhancing skill of keeping hydrated at school. This lesson was such a hit with my youngest students that I decided to take a risk and lead the exact same lesson with my 5th and 6th graders, crayons and all. The class went extremely well and I was delighted to see students across every grade level toting their new water bottles around school and keeping them at their desks. While using a single lesson for preschool through sixth grade is an exception, it was a reminder to me that thinking outside the box with lesson plans can help engage students and deepen their understanding, moving them beyond simple slogans and toward informed, healthy decision-making.
                  <br /><br /> In addition to the water lesson plan just described, I am including a photo of an activity in which students “acted out” digestion with newspapers, pennies, a spray bottle and a few other tools. I am also including pictures from a seat belt safety class for first and second graders, which involved learning Newton’s law that objects in motion tend to stay in motion, practicing the theory by playing Red Light, Green light, and, finally, demonstrating how seat belts keep bodies from moving by simulating a Lego “crash” with and without seat belts in place. These photos demonstrate my commitment to teaching highly engaging health classes to maximize student learning and acquisition of skills.
